Here are three brands:

## [SOFTFAB.org](https://softfab.org/)

Open-source tools for fashion design (or anything 3d, like stuffed animals, sculptural creations) Tips / patrons support welcome. (demo)
See also: [Meemoo](http://meemoo.org/), [Clo3d](http://www.clo3d.com/), [Continuum Fashion](http://www.continuumfashion.com/constrvct.php), [Free Sewing](https://freesewing.org/about/)

## SEAMSTER.club

Platform to share designs, offer manufacturing services, and buy clothing made to fit. System to tip: if I make and sell your design i'll tip you 5%. If I like Softfab.org for making designs I'll throw them 0.1%. People offering sewing services set prices. (Distributed power, distributed means of production.) Can use base of materials and estimated seam length (sewing time). Open-source and transparent formula.

## [FRIENDSDAY.fi](http://friendsday.fi/)

The first manufacturing collective on the Seamster.club platform, based in Brasstown, NC. Slowly growing catalog. Possible to design your own (dress, shirt, animal) and we would sew it from ♻︎ material?

* How to brand them as a unified pitch?
* Should we brand them as unified pitch?
* With Seamster, how to take the good of gig economy without the douchey parts?

Any one of these brands would be (several) full-time jobs. I guess I want to just sketch it out like this and start harassing everybody I can find to help me make it reality.
